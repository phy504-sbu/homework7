1. Write a class called `Rectangle`.  Have the constructor take the
   length and height and write *member functions* to compute and
   return the area and perimeter, and another member function
   `is_square()` that returns `true` if the rectangle is also a
   square.

   You should be able to do something like this:

   ```
   rect = Rectange(1.0, 2.0);
   double area = rect.area();
   ```
